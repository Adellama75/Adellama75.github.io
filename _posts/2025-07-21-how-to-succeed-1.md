## Foundations

the equivalence of a functioning industrial supply chain - machine tools, OEMs, skilled labour force and engineers, and of course basic insitutions for trade - is a functioning personal supply chain - of food, of tools like modelling software and books, of sanity.


### The Rule of Law

[developing countries needs stable institutions for development]
Douglass North

courts, business contract enforcement capacity. Political stability.

resource cursed coutnries and why they do not have a rule of law


Poor Economics - uncertainty management

developing countries need power, water and roads.



**GROUND ABSTRACT CONCEPTS WITH EXAMPLES**
"you can get away with ignoring maintenance for a time, until suddenly everything shuts down in a cascade failure." then sharpen it with a sub-analogy on JUST HOW BAD missing sleep screws a person *or* the same for component defects in engineering systems. lean into specifics + humor.



### A Stable Home


Let's work backwards to find the equivalent list of things that a student would need to get an A on an exam. 

f(access to past exam material, time, effort)

time means the student must start with enough time to cover the material 4-5 times, for each question on the past exams.

effort also has some prerequisites, those that are correlated with the ability to sit and focus on answering and recalling the answers before you.

breaking down effort = E(hunger, restedness, stress, motivation, etc.)

Motivation is a big one and can overcome deficiencies in some other areas temporarily. We'll cover that in the second part of the series. All the rest of the factors that go into "effort" and "time" I'm going to classify as the foundations to achieving what you want in education.


I have been a resource cursed person.

Finding early and middle education easy is not naturaly amenable to developing functioning governing institutions. (legacy businesses that do not or can not innovate)

What things have I accumulated since last year?

- ability to make food (causes a lot less stress now) == stability, reduced reliance on aid

- a stable sleep routine (pharmaceutically assisted) == stable, planned maintenance for uptime
- ability to maintain a comfortable working space (hygiene and maintanence) == stable, ongoing maintenance of hard infrastructure for reliability

- ability to live with others (how to interact with them) == basic diplomacy, not cause problems

- friends to help me with being emotionally regulated and available to study == state governing capacity, slack

- a better general direction in terms of awareness of skills and working roles. Models like Anson Yu, etc. == beginning state capacity, consensus on what they want to do

- better at feeling comfortable in public and in presentations (grooming, clothes) == ability to negotiate and trade
- financial clarity and security (family situation finally becoming stable and me being aware of it) == balanced, stable, plannable budget


almost there:
- exercise
- self-built system to process notes (put them into a standard format)
- task monitoring and priorotisation software (with the points)
