## Foundations

Prerequisites of a market economy pre-industrialisation include some state capcity - ability of the state to enforce laws (best example: contracts and property rights) and collect taxes. Tax collection goes to fund enforcement as well as public goods - ideally some of roads, power, water, public education. These are prerequisites because it allows smaller businesses to not worry about the provision of these services at scale, whose benefit is diffuse and which they cannot individually fully enjoy - in practice, if provided to a sufficient quality and extent, worrying about these things can be "abstracted away" from businesses to the state.

There are also prerequisites to being effectively educated, on an individual student level. Of course, individuals (and individual businesses) can buck the trend, but that doesn't stop these prerequisites from being needed in the statistical sense. For a student, prerequisites to succeeding in education include reliable access to food, water, shelter and healthcare that prevents debilitation and that minimises the impact of conditions on ability to study. A student also needs provisions: reliable access to notes to learn from, and for best effect tests to study to. In some curricula the student also needs to learn field-specific software (simulation, modelling, version control) as part of the curriculum.

Argument: due to unforseen reasons, I lacked many of these prerequisites at the beginning of the last year, but I have since been gaining them at a steady pace, and am en route to estimating having all of them in October 2026. (If I don't I would be very surprised.)



### State Capacity

One of my persistent interests, in times of good and bad, is learning about how countries develop. Our living standards have risen greatly, in some countries within the last couple of decades (Korea and China), many-fold. With this surplus comes stability and a better life for all citizens of that country, and many interesting things to talk about, like their cultural exports, and technological ones too. Which makes me interested in development as a robust tool for poverty alleviation.

I like the way a few economic historians talk about it in particular: Fukuyama, Solow, Douglass North.

North talks about institutions. 

Fukuyama talks about state capacity.

Solow talks about capital stock.

The common thread between them is that they study what prerequisites, what quality and quantity of them, at t=0 is necessary or sufficient to make a country grow when you press play.


Institutions; state capacity; rules for trade; capital stock.

Here is a simplified model:

1. the way out of poverty since the industrial revolution has been a functioning market economy.

2. markets need a certain level of state capacity to function. This includes assurances like property rights and rule of law, and some infrastructure like roads. [growth-promoting, inclusive institutions]

3. the state is normally the one who sets up those conditions: enforcing property rights and rule of law, and providing public goods. So that firms do not have to worry about who is providing a court of arbitrage, protection against robbery, or public goods like a worker base and roads. [state capacity] The state needs to do all these because individual firms are not in a relatively good position to do this.






I REALIZE I KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS THAN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING OK SHUT UP. UNFORTUNATELY ECONOMICS ISN'T ITSELF A SECTOR WITH HIGH REAL PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH POTENTIAL. IF ONLY IT WAS AS INTERESTING AS FIXING LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE ISSUE FOR A WHOLE SOCIETY AT A TIME.






good rules and effective enforcement "state capacity" are needed for development.

This can be called state capacity. ("State capacity describes the ability of a state to collect taxes, enforce law and order, and provide public goods [banks, trade ministries, courts], and services like education, public health, infrastructure.")



[developing countries needs stable institutions for development]
Douglass North

resource cursed countries without stable institutions???

developing countries need power, water and roads. Without these factors, places do not develop.

State capacity means governance ability and some fiscal slack. The effects of having this are that the state can begin to invest in revenue-generating activities. Roads, power, rail, a labour force with basic skills. With this basic level of competency at governance, the state can then invest in incentivising companies to form and for those companies to compete against each other, following the state's incentives, forming an industrial base.

CAPEX and shut-off of large chemical processing complexes. Which plants have been treated this way before? Have any been retrofitted and came back online much much better, despite the cost of shutdown and missed production? How did it get retrofitted?

### Spoon Theory / Maintenance

Imagine if you were a student studying for a set of exams. Let's work backwards to find the equivalent minimum list of things that a student would need to get an A on an exam. 

1. The way to ace exams is 80% accounted for by learning to the test.

2. learning to the test requires the student repeatedly spending time and effort to memorize relevant material being tested. The student needs free time and energy in order to do this.

3. With good planning and skills aquisition, the student can compress the time and effort needed by other parts of her life, in order to free up time and energy to study. They have to do this ahead of time, because  some of these investments take an amount of time and energy that directly hurts their bottom line of how much they can study. You cannot industrialise without roads and semi-reliable power, and you cannot learn to cook if cooking takes 5 hours due to a cascade of missing groceries and tools.

And apart from tool acquisition, there are other fixed costs.

What is needed?
-> no more basic concerns: hunger, stress, restedness



All the rest of the factors that go into "effort" and "time" I'm going to classify as the "foundations" to achieving what you want in education.

Motivation is the next level of the game. We'll cover that in the second part of the series. 



Now we have an equivalent (if simplified) of the prerequisites that are needed at the bottom level to succeed in studies.



Time and energy savings (from abstraction and practice of recurring tasks) will increase fiscal capacity. Enforcement mechanisms will increase legal capacity (and social norms will offset this to a significant amount anyway).

### My Experience

Do I have these foundations?

A year ago, not necessarily. Right now, yes! We have increased state capacity, by a lot.


1.  a human needs a set of foundations to sustain itself and generate enough slack that can be reinvested into education and skills practice. These two are seperate but connected.

I have been a resource cursed person. Finding early and middle education easy is not naturaly amenable to developing functioning governing institutions. (legacy businesses that do not or can not innovate)




What things have I accumulated since last year?

- ability to make food (causes a lot less stress now) == stability, reduced reliance on aid

- a stable sleep routine (pharmaceutically assisted) == stable, planned maintenance for uptime
- ability to maintain a comfortable working space (hygiene and maintanence) == stable, ongoing maintenance of hard infrastructure for reliability

- ability to live with others (how to interact with them) == basic diplomacy, not cause problems

- friends to help me with being emotionally regulated and available to study == state governing capacity, slack

- a better general direction in terms of awareness of skills and working roles. Models like Anson Yu, etc. == beginning state capacity, consensus on what they want to do

- better at feeling comfortable in public and in presentations (grooming, clothes) == ability to negotiate and trade
- financial clarity and security (family situation finally becoming stable and me being aware of it) == balanced, stable, plannable budget



almost there:
- exercise
- self-built system to process notes (put them into a standard format)
- task monitoring and priorotisation software (with the points)


"long-term goals will no longer get vetoed by short-term crises." there will be less variation on output ability.

I've raised state capacity. that translates straight into:
- lower marginal cost of one deep‑work hour
- bigger slack buffer you can reinvest in upskilling
- stable, linear slack that is generated again and again. — same math as countries finally breaking transport bottlenecks and watching exports explode. Solow's Model.
    

**GROUND ABSTRACT CONCEPTS WITH EXAMPLES**
use concrete analogy on JUST HOW BAD missing sleep screws a person *or* the same for component defects in engineering systems. lean into specifics + humor.



I have been gaining these foundations at a reliable rate, including having most of them already, compared  to a year ago. A year ago, I didn't have any of this, and made enough mistakes to learn how to solve them.



*Explain it for newcomers to both fields. make it clear that I am organizing my thinking this way because development is the one closest area I know and care about, even if it's not relevant to chemical engineering intuitively."
