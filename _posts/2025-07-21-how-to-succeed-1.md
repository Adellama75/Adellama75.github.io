### A Stable Home

I have been a resource cursed person.

What things have I accumulated since last year?

- ability to make food (causes a lot less stress now)
- a stable sleep routine (pharmaceutically assisted)
- ability to live with others (how to interact with them)
- ability to maintain a comfortable working space (hygiene and maintanence)

- friends to help me with being emotionally regulated and available to study
- a better general direction in terms of awareness of skills and working roles. Models like Anson Yu, etc. 
- better at feeling comfortable in public and in presentations (grooming, clothes)
- financial clarity and security (family situation finally becoming stable and me being aware of it)


almost there:
- exercise
- self-built system to process notes (put them into a standard format)
- task monitoring and priorotisation software (with the points)
