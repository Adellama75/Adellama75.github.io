## Foundations

the equivalence of a functioning industrial supply chain - machine tools, OEMs, skilled labour force and engineers, and of course basic insitutions for trade - is a functioning personal supply chain - of food, of tools like modelling software and books, of sanity.

### A Stable Home

What things have I accumulated since last year?

- ability to make food (causes a lot less stress now)
- a stable sleep routine (pharmaceutically assisted)
- ability to live with others (how to interact with them)
- ability to maintain a comfortable working space

- friends to help me with being emotionally regulated and available to study
- a better general direction i am heading towards. in terms of awareness of skills and working roles. models like anson yu, etc. 
- better at feeling comfortable in public and in presentations (grooming, clothes)
- financial clarity and security (family situation finally becoming stable and me being aware of it)


to come:
- exercise
- system to process notes
- self-built task monitoring and priorotisation software
