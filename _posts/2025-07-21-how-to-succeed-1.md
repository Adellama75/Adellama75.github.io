## Foundations

A necessary prerequisite of a market economy before it can industrialise is state capacity - meaning the ability of a government to enforce laws and collect taxes. The taxes collected goes to fund enforcement of laws (like contracts and property rights) as well as public goods - like roads, power, water, and public education. 

These are prerequisites because it allows smaller businesses to not worry about the provision of these services at scale, whose benefit is diffuse and which they cannot individually fully enjoy. If provided to a sufficient quality and quantity, the provision of these services can be "abstracted away" from businesses to the state.


There are also prerequisites to being effectively educated, on an individual student level. (of course, individuals can buck the trend, but that doesn't stop these prerequisites from being needed in the statistical sense.) For a student, these include reliable access to food, water, shelter and healthcare that prevents debilitation and minimises the impact of existing conditions on ability to study. In my view, these are like the overhead items provided by the state for firms - things that are necessary to have, but too complicated to reinvent for each individual in the day-to-day, and allows them to be resilient against setbacks.

After that, a student (given they are at least average smart) only needs a couple of course-related things: reliable access to notes to learn from, mock tests to study to, and often field-specific software (simulation, version control software) - to be fully effective in meeting requirements.

While not realising it, I lacked many of these prerequisites at the beginning of the last year, but I have since been gaining them at a steady pace, and am en route to having all of them by October 2026. I firmly believe it's not magic that determines whether someone fails or succeeds at a given task, just prerequisites we can mark and kill with time and the correct procedures followed.


### State Capacity

One of my persistent interests is learning about how countries develop. Our living standards have risen greatly, in some countries many-fold within the last couple of decades (Korea and China). With this economic surplus comes stability and a better life for everyone, and many interesting things: K-pop, K-dramas, new better consumer brands, scientific research results. But more basic than that, economic development is a robust tool for poverty alleviation.

I like the way a few economic historians talk about it in particular: Fukuyama, Solow, Douglass North. North talks about [institutions](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fjep.5.1.97). Fukuyama talks about [state capacity](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/54670). Solow talks about [capital stock](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1926047). The common thread between them is the question of what prerequisites present at t=0 are necessary and sufficient to make a country grow, once you press play.


Here is a simplified model:

1. The way out of poverty since the industrial revolution has been a functioning market economy - one that manufactures.

2. Markets need a certain level of state capacity to function. This includes assurances like property rights and rule of law, and some infrastructure like roads. 

3. The state is normally the one who sets up those conditions: enforcing property rights and rule of law, and providing public goods. So that firms do not have to worry about who is providing a court of arbitrage, protect them against robbery, or public goods like a worker base and roads.



What does "state capacity" mean? State capacity describes the ability of a state to collect taxes, enforce law and order, and provide [public goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-good.asp) and services like education, public health, infrastructure. More abstracted, it means governance ability and some fiscal slack. The observable effects of "having state capacity" are that the state can begin to invest. Roads, power, rail, a labour force with basic skills. With a basic level of competency at governance, firms are possible to form and if an environment with consistent export pressure is maintained, firms will respond to the incentives to up their productivity, and in the process [create an industrial base](https://ia902902.us.archive.org/33/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.147391/2015.147391.Economic-Backwardness-In-Historical-Perspective.pdf). 



On the flip side, resource cursed countries often don't evolve state capacity. 







The takeaway is that there are a set of fundamental things upstream of having an effective economy that must be set up, or else good things don't happen and countries don't develop.


### The Maintenance Race

Imagine if you were a student studying for a set of exams. Let's work backwards to find the equivalent mechanistic list of things that a student would need to get an A in the exams. 

1. The way to ace exams is 80% accounted for by learning to the test.

2. learning to the test requires the student repeatedly spending time and effort to memorize relevant material being tested. The student needs free time and energy in order to do this, of which there is limited per day.

3. With good planning and skills aquisition, the student can compress the time and effort needed by other parts of her life, in order to free up time and energy to study. She has to do this ahead of time, because  some of these investments take an amount of time and energy that directly hurts her bottom line of how much time and energy she can put towards studying each day. For example, it's very difficult to learn to cook if cooking takes 3 hours due to missing ingredients and tools and unfamiliarity with cutting vegetables.


Can we work out a mutually exclusive, collectively exaustive set of factors for the student to cover? In general, it's short-term worries over long-term worries. To have food takes time and effort (whether via money, travel, or preparation time), using up a part of the day and, even if slightly unpredictable, adds a some amount of stress to the day.

Time discounting is the basic mechanism by which stress and tiredness acts on ability to settle down and study. More stress means lower time horizon and higher discounting meaning less motivation for long-term investments (like studying is). Ways to diminish this effect (as well as reducing ongoing stress) include streamlining other activities [PREREQUISITES] and making studying an activity with a very small time delay to payoff [MOTIVATION].

There are generally ways to transmute stressors into other types of stressors. For example, if hunger is a current stressor, there are options to use different amounts of time or money to acquire food, transmuting a need for food to a need for time, energy or money. Everything more complicated but defined such as "access to healthcare" could be reduced, in my opinion, to a mix of time, energy and money (which are interchangable to an extent, while none of which are infinite). 

Now we have an equivalent (if simplified) set of the fundamental things that are needed to succeed in studies. Time and energy savings (from abstraction and practice of recurring tasks) will increase personal executive capacity. For our special case, money can be assumed to be held constant, but still not infinite, through parental transfers.



### My Experience
Do I have these foundations?

A year ago, not necessarily. Right now, yes! We have increased personal capacity, by a lot.

1. a human needs a set of foundations to sustain itself and generate enough slack that can be reinvested into education and skills practice. These two are seperate but connected. motivation is the causal mechanism of this: stress means less motivation to invest in the future, and more motivation to fix things now.

I have been a resource cursed person. Finding early and middle education surprisingly easy is not naturaly amenable to developing functioning governing institutions (healthy and functional habits). But rent-seeking is not a sustainable mode of operation, and I am working on reinvent myself to be good at the tasks I am asked to perform today, and stay competitive.

What things have I accumulated since last year?

- ability to make food (causes a lot less stress now)

- a stable sleep routine (pharmaceutically assisted) -> we fixed it my temporarily going on sleep meds, for a couple of months, and coming off them.
- ability to maintain a comfortable working space (hygiene and maintanence)
- ability to live with others (how to interact with them)
- friends to help me with being emotionally regulated and available to study - reducing bad emotional variance
- a better general direction in terms of awareness of skills and working roles. Models like Anson Yu, Hudzah, and friends like Yoyo and Fish
- better at feeling comfortable in public and in presentations (grooming, clothes) - ability to negotiate and trade with the wider world


almost there:
- exercise
- self-built system to process notes (put them into a standard format)



task monitoring and priorotisation software (with points as real rewards) and related enforcement mechanisms, when they are set up, will increase [MOTIVATION] which increases the energy available for a task (not time or money).


"long-term goals will no longer get vetoed by short-term crises." there will be less variation on output ability.

I've raised state capacity. that translates straight into:
- lower marginal cost of one deep‑work hour
- bigger slack buffer I can reinvest in upskilling
- stable, linear slack that is generated again and again.

all of this mean you should expect me to perform at a much higher baseline rate, in my next year in university.    

I have been gaining these foundations at a reliable rate, including having most of them already, compared  to a year ago. A year ago, I didn't have any of this, and made enough mistakes to learn how to solve them.

Chemical Plants operate on a 3-7 year shutdown cycle. 

CAPEX and shut-off of large chemical processing complexes. Which plants have been treated this way before? Have any been retrofitted and came back online much much better, despite the cost of shutdown and missed production? How did it get retrofitted?



TL;DR:
"""
i’m requesting a one-year deferral because i need to trade a short, known delay for durable upgrades to my personal infrastructure. the plan is straightforward: learn to cook so meals aren’t a daily energy drain; lock in a pharmaceutically-assisted sleep schedule; create my workspace so it stays low-friction; practice co-living skills so i can share living space smoothly; build a small peer circle that keeps me emotionally regulated and study-ready; practice selected new skills against real job descriptions; and tighten grooming and presentation habits. think of it like a chemical plant shutting down for maintenance—scrubbing fouled pipes, swapping a few 1980-era valves, and installing a better control panel—except the plant is me, and the payoff is higher throughput for the rest of my degree. i’ll return in september 2026 with more capacity, less downtime, and zero extra cost to the university.
