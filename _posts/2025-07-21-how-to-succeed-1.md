## Foundations

the equivalence of a functioning industrial supply chain - machine tools, OEMs, skilled labour force and engineers, and of course basic insitutions for trade - is a functioning personal supply chain - of food, of tools like modelling software and books, of sanity.


### State Capacity

One of my persistent interests, in times of good and bad, is learning about how countries develop. Our living standards have risen greatly, in some countries within the last couple of decades (Korea and China), many-fold. With this surplus comes stability and a better life for all citizens of that country, and many interesting things to talk about, like their cultural exports, and technological ones too.



Here is a simplified model:

1. the way out of poverty since the industrial revolution has been a functioning market economy.

2. market economies need property rights and rule of law.

3. the state is normally the one who sets up those conditions: enforcing property rights and rule of law.

This can be called state capacity. ("State capacity describes the ability of a state to collect taxes, enforce law and order, and provide public goods [banks, trade ministries, courts], and services like education, public health, infrastructure.")

I am oversimplifying here and using a lot of words, but (i hope) these words are back up by emperical observations from historical records that everyone can see, and some that are in living memory.

developing countries need power, water and roads.

use concrete analogy on JUST HOW BAD missing sleep screws a person *or* the same for component defects in engineering systems. lean into specifics + humor.




### Personal Effectiveness




Let's work backwards to find the equivalent list of things that a student would need to get an A on an exam. 

1. Access to past exam material

2. Learning to the test (accounting for most of the way to an A grade)

3. putting in enough time, multiplied by enough effort

Time means the student must start with enough time to cover the material 4-5 times, for each question on the past exams.

effort also has some prerequisites, those that are correlated with the ability to sit and focus on answering and recalling the answers before you.

breaking down effort = E(hunger, restedness, stress, motivation, etc.)

Motivation is a big one and can overcome deficiencies in some other areas temporarily. We'll cover that in the second part of the series. All the rest of the factors that go into "effort" and "time" I'm going to classify as the "foundations" to achieving what you want in education.


Do I have these foundations?

A year ago, not necessarily. Right now, yes! We have increased state capacity, by a lot.


1.  a human needs an analogous set of foundations to sustain itself and generate enough slack that can be reinvested into education and skills practice. These two are seperate but connected.




I have been a resource cursed person.



Finding early and middle education easy is not naturaly amenable to developing functioning governing institutions. (legacy businesses that do not or can not innovate)




What things have I accumulated since last year?

- ability to make food (causes a lot less stress now) == stability, reduced reliance on aid

- a stable sleep routine (pharmaceutically assisted) == stable, planned maintenance for uptime
- ability to maintain a comfortable working space (hygiene and maintanence) == stable, ongoing maintenance of hard infrastructure for reliability

- ability to live with others (how to interact with them) == basic diplomacy, not cause problems

- friends to help me with being emotionally regulated and available to study == state governing capacity, slack

- a better general direction in terms of awareness of skills and working roles. Models like Anson Yu, etc. == beginning state capacity, consensus on what they want to do

- better at feeling comfortable in public and in presentations (grooming, clothes) == ability to negotiate and trade
- financial clarity and security (family situation finally becoming stable and me being aware of it) == balanced, stable, plannable budget


almost there:
- exercise
- self-built system to process notes (put them into a standard format)
- task monitoring and priorotisation software (with the points)


"long-term goals will no longer get vetoed by short-term crises."



*you don't have to do a 1-to-1 correspondence*

you’ve raised state capacity. that translates straight into:

- lower marginal cost of one deep‑work hour

- bigger slack buffer you can reinvest in upskilling

- compounding gains—same math as countries finally breaking transport bottlenecks and watching exports explode.
    


3. I have been gaining these foundations at a reliable rate, including having most of them already, compared  to a year ago.

*Explain it for newcomers to both fields. make it clear that I am organizing my thinking this way because development is the one closest area I know and care about, even if it's not relevant to chemical engineering intuitively."
