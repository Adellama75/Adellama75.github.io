## Knowledge Transfer

The equivalence of modernising production methods is copying studying habits from the top performers, and the equivalence of acquiring the ability to manufacture more advanced goods (i.e. acquiring technology) is internalising chunks of knowledge at a level to be applied in its context.

### The Tech Transfer Playbook

isolating environments where there is no knowledge diffusion [reference knowledge diffusion californian tech firms] prevents productivity gains from this diffusion.

consultants help increase productiviy [indian firms]. this makes a case for learning tacit knowledge from outside of your existing environment, one that's optimised to compete already in its area.

consultants in a less-developed context are different than their ability in a developed context. they embody the accumulated tacit knowledge from years of industrial development and operations and can bring known and reliable methods to firms in areas which this knowledge has not diffused to.

### Peers and Scenes

Peers are important.

> Home life only goes so far in shaping a child's personality. The bulk of it gets forged in the child's social life outside the home — among his or her peers. Peers are important because they're our main competitors, collaborators, and sexual partners — the people we play social games with throughout our lives. Additionally, they're the best reference class for learning about our own strengths and weaknesses (whether we're ugly or beautiful, dull or clever, etc.). As Judith Rich Harris explains in No Two Alike, we can't learn these things from our family:

scenes - gwern
scenes - henrik karlsson
science is a strong link problem

Getting into scenes by doing them / making friends by doing things.

bourgeois dignity

rock climbing

bubbles - sarah constantin, scott alexander, robin hanson


I have found who my friends are through the internet, finally. instagram was not the platform for me because it does not show how things are done. And it is populated by different kinds of people.
