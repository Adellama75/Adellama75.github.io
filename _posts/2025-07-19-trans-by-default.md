[Personality: The Body in Society](https://meltingasphalt.com/personality-the-body-in-society/)

Traits come on a bell curve. Gendered traits are broadly correlated with one another, genetically and game theoretically. Imagine that 2% of men land in the middle of the female bell curve, and 2% of women land in the middle of the male curve. 0.7% of the population poll as transgender. Let's assume the true prevalence of "transgender" if there is no stigma against them is 3x0.7% = 2%.

My year group in high school (generally a respectful space) has a 3/150 = 2% prevalence. I am maybe the 3th girliest out of 75 boys which means i'm in the 4% of opposite-sex traited. To me, these numbers make sense. I am definitely closer to the female median than the male on the measure, and more in line with female culture than male culture.

These non-typical traits then, would make me perform worse than average as a guy, and at least average as a girl, in being legible in the wider cishet-normative society in which we live. Legibility is important - it's the foundation for stability and long term mutually beneficial skill, information and resource exchange relationships. You must be legible to fit into society, which is something I desire.

My personality is not totally random; given that I am a child of a Chinese immigrant in the West, I am mildly selected to be smart, take things literally, physically weak (no matter if it's cultural or genetic). I am physically weak becase it has not been that bad to be physically weak, in the context of Chinese society and expectations for children to study for examinations and my social class (most classes that is not farming or assembly line work). By chance I am dependent for affection, and full of love. These last two are random, but also strongly point in the female social role direction.

Being a man, and being held to the standards of men, is not a realistic choice for me. The realistic, workable choice is being held to the standards of women, which is much more viable. Even if it's not a full replacement, just an escape, it will help me function. I do not want to be seen as a threat. I need to be seen as something to be protected. This applies especially in closer personal relations, not partners but even close friends. I will not do well if held to standards I cannot fulfil.

I have a learnt disgust response for a male body. As long as society is the way it is and treat males as males, this won't go away. I have never cared about a fully functional male body. It does not provide me with anything I want, but layers on expectations i cannot fulfil. It makes people treat me like someone who is going to cause harm. I am not going to cause harm - I'm not wired for harm! I fantasise about marriage, and caring for each other!

Either my body or my personality will continue to be a burden on the other, if nothing changes. I don't know how to change my personality but I do know how to change my body. The person you know is not my body but my head, I do not feel embodied, things can happen to it independent of the person. Having a female or even intersex body does not stop me from performing economically valuable activities, such as programming, tinkering, studying and writing exams. It reduces my day-to-day stress, external and self-inflicted, and allows me more space to practice these valuable activities, and therefore qualitatively improve my performance. 

I stressed a ton about these exact issues which hormones would fix and have fixed in other people. I can point to PhD students and assisstant professors and successful, normal people! Future me will sample from this space, I am trying to get there, and it will be okay! I do not see how it will be the same level of ok if I don't go for this eventually. If I don't, I will continue to suffer and be stressed every single day. 

Society or personality is hard to change, but biology, to the extent i want it, is easy and safe to change and people will not die or get hurt.
