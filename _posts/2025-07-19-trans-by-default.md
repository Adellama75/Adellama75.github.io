[Personality: The Body in Society](https://meltingasphalt.com/personality-the-body-in-society/)

Traits come on a bell curve. Gendered traits are broadly correlated with one another. 0.7% of the population poll as transgender. Let's assume the true prevalence of "transgender" if there is no stigma against them is 3*0.7% = 2%. Imagine that 2% of men land in the middle of the female bell curve, and 2% of women land in the middle of the male curve. We can estimate these numbers to be close to one another.

My year group in high school (generally a respectful space) has a 3/150 = 2% prevalence of transgender high school kids. I am maybe the 3th girliest out of 75 boys which means i'm in the top 4% of opposite-sex traited students, or 1 in 25. I am definitely closer to the female median than the male on the measure, and more in line with female culture than male culture. To me, these numbers make sense. 

These non-typical traits then, would make me perform worse than average as a guy, and at least average as a girl, in being legible in the wider cishet-normative society in which we live. Legibility is important - it's the foundation for stability and long term mutually beneficial skill, information and resource exchange relationships. You must be legible to fit into society, which is something I desire.

My personality is not totally random; given that I am a child of a Chinese immigrant in the West, I am mildly selected to be smart, take things literally, physically weak (no matter if it's cultural or genetic). I am physically weak becase it has not been that bad to be physically weak, in the context of Chinese society and expectations for children to study for examinations and my social class (most classes that is not farming or assembly line work). By chance I am dependent for affection, and full of love. These last two are random, but also strongly point in the female social role direction.

Being a man, and being held to the standards of men, is not a realistic choice for me. The realistic, workable choice is being held to the standards of women. Even if it's not a full replacement, just an escape, it will help me function. I need to be seen as something to be protected. I will not do well if held to standards I cannot fulfil.

As long as society treat males as they are currently being treated, my response won't go away. A male body does not provide me with anything I want, except layers of expectations I cannot fulfil. It makes people treat me like someone who is going to cause harm. But I fantasise about marriage, and caring and being cared for. I'm not at all wired to cause harm!

Either my body or my personality will continue to be a burden on the other, if nothing changes. I don't know how to change my personality but I do know how to change my body. Having a female or even intersex body will not stop me from performing economically valuable activities, such as programming, tinkering, studying and writing exams. It reduces my day-to-day stress, both external and learned, and qualitatively improves my performance.

I have already stressed a ton about these issues - which hormones would fix and have fixed in other people. I can point to PhD students and assisstant professors and other successful, normal people. I am trying to get there, and it will be okay! If I don't get endocrine intervention, I expect I will continue to suffer and be stressed every single day, as it has been for the last 6 years.

Society or personality is hard to change, but biology is easy and safe to change and people will not die or get hurt.
