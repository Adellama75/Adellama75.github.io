## Succeeding in any Persuit - Ada's Bet





## Ecosystems

The ecosystem is the rewards and incentives around me. It's equivalent to socialisation in the "prototype vs socialisation framework" - or the environment an RL agent acts in.


## Niches

The niche is the pocket where RL agents exist to exploit their ecosystem, stay snug and comfy, etc. 

Agents (in this case people) have to pick a niche to exploit, but they don't know where the best one is, so there is first a process of exploration.



## The Tech Transfer Playbook

Catching up to the frontier of technology shares a key simularity with doing well in education. You must curate an ecosystem, because that ecosystem is what produces what you want, day-in and day-out. Manufacturing is difficult, it has a lot of prerequisites that fan out before you on the supply chain, that loop around. So is education.

With the freedom to choose my surroundings, I gain a large vantage point; as large as the role of the government in directing state subsidies and support.

it's infrastructure, incentive and knowledge transfer. [ecosystem is being overloaded A LOT] 1. firms who supply you and your competitors 2. government who gives you subsidies, targets and FDI 3. your competitors who you can copy from, local and global.

it's stable foundations, incentives (local) and learning the competitive best practices.


But these are just illustrations, because they're problems i'm familiar with. the RL and agent framing is actually the most general one. state-supported firms are agents. states are also agents - ones that manage other agents. I am also an agent in the context of persuing my goal of performing well in education, and I have responsibility over myself in the day-to-day, who optimises only for what i'd like to do at any point in time. The state wants its firms to be capable of using the best, most modern technology to produce the best export products. I (the planner) want myself (the executor) to be able to use the best methods of studying to gain the best scores on standardised tests and the best methods of skills acquisition to make the best results in/contributions to practical projects. These issues map. They are both agentic persuits optimising for incentive design, foundation building and knowledge transfer [both leading-edge tech and course syllabi and practical tasks being known, solved problems].


>2. infrastructure matters more than the blueprint

most industrial catch-up fails not from lack of info, but lack of process control + QA

most students fail not due to lack of knowledge, but lack of habit formation, executive function, emotional stability

you don’t need the best textbooks. you need a reliable environment to iterate in.

3. pipeline effects dominate

tech transfer works when you build an institutional memory

students succeed when surrounded by other students who normalize hard work, good strategies, and resilience

you’re not "copying a curriculum" — you're embedding in a self-reinforcing educational-industrial cluster.

Many countries would like to develop. Many students would like to get good at studying.

I'm going to cast the second problem into the first and take a page from the Chinese government's technology transfer playbook. Specifically, how they have fostered and created globally competitive industrial ecosystems across multiple different industries over 10s of years of support.

modernisation at this speed depends on lots of technology transfer from outside the country. so too, for most of the beginning of your academic journey, does learning mean memorizing and internalising existing knowledge.

the equivalence of a functioning industrial supply chain - machine tools, OEMs, skilled labour force and engineers - is a functioning personal supply chain - of food, of tools like modelling software and books, of sanity. The end product is export-quality goods vs competitive scores on a standardised test, and by extension brand recognition (inertia, staying power) and a recognized personal ability to contribute to the field. The equivalence of modernising production methods is copying studying habits from the top performers, and the equivalence of acquiring the ability to manufacture more advanced goods (i.e. acquiring technology) is internalising chunks of knowledge at a level to be applied in its context.

these problems both have binding pockets shaped like "knowledge acquisition" and "incentive design".


tech ecosystems have components that support each other to form (in a healthy state) a functioning whole. Even when each actor is only following their own incentives as they see them.

Peers are important.

> Home life only goes so far in shaping a child's personality. The bulk of it gets forged in the child's social life outside the home — among his or her peers. Peers are important because they're our main competitors, collaborators, and sexual partners — the people we play social games with throughout our lives. Additionally, they're the best reference class for learning about our own strengths and weaknesses (whether we're ugly or beautiful, dull or clever, etc.). As Judith Rich Harris explains in No Two Alike, we can't learn these things from our family:
