# Writers
You will find most of these technical writers' work in my monthly roundups.
[Austin Vernon](https://austinvernon.site/) - new technology & commodities
[Abhishaike Mahajan (Owl Posting)](https://www.owlposting.com/) - biotechnology
[Brian Potter (Construction Physics)](https://ifp.org/author/brian-potter/) - infrastructure
[Sarah Constantin](https://www.sarah-constantin.org/writing) - new technology & biology

You will generally not find these two society writers in my monthly roundups.
[Kelsey Piper](https://x.com/KelseyTuoc) - society, current
Kelsey's work is defining/representative of a branch of California centre-left technocrats, which means she tends to write more belligerent than the median person who holds some of these ideas.
[Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/) - society, past
Scott's work was best in the 2010s under Slate Star Codex rather than in the 2020s- under [Astral Codex Ten](https://www.astralcodexten.com/). he writes a LOT meaning some of my favourite posts are niche in the [overall scheme of his writing](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/), and probably yours will be too!
