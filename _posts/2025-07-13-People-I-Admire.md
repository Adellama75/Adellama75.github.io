These are generally people which I'd like to point myself in the direction of becoming more like - in terms of producing output like theirs. I think being able to make what they make is a rare and valuable ability, and I sometimes wish to have known about this general catagory of people sooner - there is much more to life than studying and corporate! I am lucky enough right now to know 2-3 of them as internet friends, may this number increase in the future.

[Abhishaike Mahajan (Owl Posting)](https://www.owlposting.com/) - biotechnology  
[Brian Potter (Construction Physics)](https://ifp.org/author/brian-potter/) - infrastructure  
[Sarah Constantin](https://www.sarah-constantin.org/writing) - new technology & biology  
_You will find most of these technical writers' work in my monthly roundups._ 
 
 
[Kelsey Piper](https://x.com/KelseyTuoc) - society, current  
Kelsey's work is defining/representative of a particular brand of Californian centre-left technocrats, which means she tends to write more belligerent than the median person who holds some of these views.  
[Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/) - society, past  
Scott's work was best in the 2010s under Slate Star Codex rather than in the 2020s- under [Astral Codex Ten](https://www.astralcodexten.com/). he writes a LOT meaning some of my favourite posts are niche in the [overall scheme of his writing](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/), and probably yours will be too!   
_You will generally not find these two society writers in my monthly roundups._ 


This list is periodically updated and not exhaustive at any point in time.
