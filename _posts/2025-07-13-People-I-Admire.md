These are generally people which I'd like to point myself in the direction of becoming more like, in terms of producing output like theirs. 

I think being able to make what they make is rare and valuable, and I often wish to have known about this broad catagory of people sooner - they show that there is much more to life than studying and competition for corporate positions!

I am lucky enough right now to have 2-3 of them as internet friends, may this number increase in the future.

### Writers (real world)

_You will generally not find these two society writers in my monthly roundups._  
[Kelsey Piper](https://x.com/KelseyTuoc) - society, current  
Kelsey's work is defining of a particular brand of Californian centre-left technocrat, which means she tends to write more belligerent than the median person with these views.  
[Scott Alexander](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/) - society, past  
Scott's work was best in the 2010s under [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/) rather than in the 2020s under [Astral Codex Ten](https://www.astralcodexten.com/). he writes a LOT, meaning some of my favourite posts are niche in the overall scheme of his writing, and probably yours will be too, but I almost guarantee he has something for you.
